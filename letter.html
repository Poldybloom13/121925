Dear Ellie,

<p>Happy Valentine's Day. Coincentally, today also marks our one month anniversary. If I had asked you one day earlier, we really would have been on brand. Now I'll have to tattoo a fourteen on myself. </p>

<p>We met on December 21, 2025. I checked the logs. Shotout Valentina and Pearson. Our next meeting was a long eight months after on September 5, 2025. Fucking London. The city that separates us. As I've told you, not much can be said on my part about our Decemeber meeting. I thought you were gorgeous, but (lust?) teeters. Our second meeting at Bar Bar however. I was rightly infatuated. I mean, how could I not be? In my inebriated state, I remember hyping myself to talk to you. You looked delectable and had great conversation. Ahhhhh. I really fumbled a whole semester with you, but maybe you're right. A sagacious woman once told me: 
</p> 

<p>"The best things are worth waiting for."</p>

<p>I know we have 85 days until we see each other again. And I know long distance will continue to be difficult. But you are worth the distance the longing, and all the trouble. I can't think of myself with anyone but you. </p>
