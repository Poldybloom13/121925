<h1>For You 💌</h1>

<p>
Dear Ellie,

<br> Happy Valentine's Day. Coincentally, today also marks our one month anniversary. If I had asked you one day earlier, we really would have been on brand. Now I'll have to tattoo a fourteen on myself. 

<br> We met on December 21, 2025. I checked the logs. Shotout Valentina and Pearson. Our next meeting was August ___, 2025. Fucking London. The city that separates us. As I've told you, not much can be said on my part about our Decemeber meeting. I thought you were gorgeous, but (VANITY) teeters. Our second meeting at Bar Bar however. I was rightly infatuated. I mean, how could I not be? In my inebriated state, I remember hyping myself to talk to you. You looked delectable and had great conversation. Ahhhhh. I really fumbled a whole semester with you, but maybe you're right. <br> "The best Things are worth waiting for."

I know we have 85 days until we see each other again. And I know long distance will continue to be difficult. But you are worth the distance the longing, and all the trouble. I can't think of myself with anyone but you.
