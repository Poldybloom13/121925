Dear Ellie,

<p>Happy Valentine's Day. Coincidentally, today also marks our one-month anniversary. If I had asked you one day earlier, we really would have been on brand. Now I'll have to tattoo a fourteen. </p>

<p>We met on December 21, 2024. I checked the logs. Shoutout to Valentina and Pearson. Our next meeting was eight months later on September 5, 2025. Fucking London - the city that continues to separate us. Our second meeting, however, got the ball rolling. I thought you were gorgeous (obviously), but desire is often unreliable. I was still madly infatuated. How could I not be? In my drunken state, I tried to prolong the conversation however I could. Your London and Japan programs, your history major, your (inferior) state of Massachusetts. I was nervous talking for so long with a pretty girl, but your bubbly demeanor and great conversation helped ease my nerves. I really fumbled a whole semester with you. I wish we had started from then, but alas. A sagacious woman once told me: 
</p> 

<p>"The best things are worth waiting for."</p>

<p>I know we have 85 days until we see each other again, and I know long distance will continue to be difficult. But you are worth the 5632.74 km distance, the nightly longing, and any trouble that may come. I can't think of myself with anyone but you. I crave every part of you. Best believe I will be kissing every part of you. And tickling. I miss you Ellie.  </p>

<p> Ale </p>
